Bombtastrophe is a challenge mod that makes the game more challenging (How suprising).
 
The challenge is...
Bombs will spawn on you every 5 seconds! (Configurible)

There are a lot of settings... and I mean A LOT! This is so that you can change the challenge to your liking!
So much so that there are countless ways to blow up...

You can make...
...bombs bounce...
...bombs fall from the sky...
...bombs destroy your world...
...bombs grow from the ground...
...projectiles explode on death....
...enemies throw bombs...
...and so much more...

Have fun!
